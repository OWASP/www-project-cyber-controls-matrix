## Description

The OWASP Cyber Controls Matrix (OCCM) is an innovation in the mapping of cyber controls across different control sets and frameworks.
<p class="callout-mono left">Solve the problem of multiple cyber standards by consolidating them, reducing timelines and effort by months. The OCCM does this and much more!</p>

#### Consolidation

Most organizations today must comply with two or more standards in their quest for enhanced Cybersecurity and compliance. This has traditionally been a very linear process, but the OCCM transforms it into a much more parallel one: de-duplicating effort. This can reduce project duration and effort by months. The OCCM means less time implementing, less time documenting, better results, and no more backtracking.

#### Knowledge

Supercharging Cybersecurity knowledge, the OCCM points cyber analysts to the guidance, insights, references, and best practices available across all standards. This greatly improves understanding of how to implement and document controls, resulting in improved security and improved audit outcomes. Costly mistakes are also avoided thanks to visibility of other standards; ensuring that decisions also satisfy future security needs, not just the immediate ones.

#### Cyber Taxonomy

There is a multi-level cyber taxonomy at the core of the OCCM, to which all the control relationships are normalized. As a result, the mappings are more consistent, objective, organized, and reliable. No more vague groupings of controls or mysterious "black box" mappings. In the OCCM, it is clear how and why each control is related. Furthermore, the OCCM Cyber Taxonomy facilitates easy research of cyber topics and objectives across all standards.

#### Levels of Detail

Controls in the OCCM are included at all available levels and each of those controls is normalized to three separate levels of detail in the OCCM Cyber Taxonomy. Audit checks are also supported. This ensures a comprehensive mapping that dives deep into the control set / framework, versus the surface mappings common in the industry that only indicate top-level controls.

Every Control entry in the OCCM is given one Control Level and is assigned one or more groups of High-Level, Medium-Level, and Low-Level Topics in the OCCM Cyber Taxonomy.

* Control Levels for Each Control

  - Control Families / Headings
  - Top-Level Controls
  - Sub-Controls
  - Enhancements
  - etc.


* Levels of Detail for Each Control

  - High-Level Topics (Area)
    - ex. "Disaster Recovery" within a Control stating "Ensure there is a <b>Disaster Recovery (H)</b> Policy (M) that identifies Roles and Responsibilities (L) and Mission-Critical Environments (L)."

  - Medium-Level Topics (Object)
    - ex. "Policy" within a Control stating "Ensure there is a Disaster Recovery (H) <b>Policy (M)</b> that identifies Roles and Responsibilities (L) and Mission-Critical Environments (L)."

  - Low-Level Topics (Target)
    - ex. "Roles and Responsibilities" within a Control stating "Ensure there is a Disaster Recovery (H) Policy (M) that identifies <b>Roles and Responsibilities (L)</b> and Mission-Critical Environments (L)."
    - ex. "Mission-Critical Environments" within a Control stating "Ensure there is a Disaster Recovery (H) Policy (M) that identifies Roles and Responsibilities (L) and <b>Mission-Critical Environments (L)</b>."

#### Relevance

Control relationships in the OCCM are directly mapped and viewable at the three separate levels of detail, resolving the fundamental issues of too-strict or too-loose mapping. Each individual control in the OCCM relates directly to other controls ("one-to-many"), instead of the common industry practice of grouping controls together ("many-to-many"). This common practice results in a handshake problem, where every control in group "A" is mapped to every other control in group "B".

For example, the group mapping "A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 -> B1, B2, B3, B4, B5" generates 25 total relationships! This requires analysis of 5 relationships per "A" control, some of which may have little to no direct relevance.

Using the OCCM, this example can be greatly simplified and reduced to...
- High Level Mapping &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A1 -> B1, B2, B3" &nbsp;&nbsp; \[3 relationships]
-	Medium Level Mapping &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A1 -> B1, B2" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \[2 relationships]
-	Low Level Mapping &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A1 -> B1" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \[1 relationship]

#### Growth

The OCCM has been designed with the principles of easy contribution, accelerated growth, and continuous improvement. Once a new control is added and normalized, it is automatically mapped to every other control across all standards. There is no longer a need for an analyst to search for a mapping between two different standards or create their own. Every standard in the OCCM is automatically mapped to every other standard, exponentially increasing its scope.

## Industry Perspectives

<p class="callout-mono right small">"Complying with multiple cybersecurity frameworks is one of the top challenges weâ€™ve heard from our Member organizations."<br>(Center for Internet Security, 3/2020)</p>

<p class="callout-mono right small">"... multiple frameworks are often needed, but the task of managing them becomes almost impossible to implement."<br>(CSO Online, 7/2010)</p>

<p class="callout-mono right small">"One major challenge compliance teams ran into again and again is that they tended to do a lot of duplicative work in order to meet multiple regulatory standards."<br>(Hyperproof, 3/2020)</p>

<p class="callout-mono right small">"Pursuing multiple frameworks at the same time can overwhelm founders, especially without expert guidance."<br>(Laika, 1/2020)</p>

## From the Creator / Project Leader

"The capabilities of the OWASP Cyber Controls Matrix are something I have wanted to see my entire career. It is my honor to create it and give it to the entire Cybersecurity industry as an open-source OWASP project. Per the license, I encourage commercial products, non-commercial products, and cyber practitioners to fully incorporate it and contribute back to the project. First and foremost, the OCCM is a community driven effort. All submissions, ideas, promotion, and discourse are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support!"
